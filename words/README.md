# Word lists

* __test.txt__ I made this one up to test my data structures. It is a short list of words, most of which appear in the boogle1-jpg test image, and some longer ones which were taken from enable1.
* __enable1.txt__ from [puzzlers.org](http://www.puzzlers.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=solving:wordlists:about:start#scrabble_tm_dictionaries). According to author's comments, this list is public domain.
